# GPX Generator

Very simple C++ GPX generator

### How to use

1. Compile
2. Make a list of coordinates called `input.txt` on the same folder as the compiled file. Each coordinate should be in individual lines, and longitude and latitude should be separated by a comma.
3. Generated GPX will be created in the same folder, as 'output.gpx'.
